NAME
       rename - renames multiple files

SYNOPSIS
       rename [ -h|-m|-V ] [ -v ] [ -n ] [ -f ] [ -e|-E perlexpr]*|perlexpr
       [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       "rename" renames the filenames supplied according to the rule specified
       as the first argument.  The perlexpr argument is a Perl expression
       which is expected to modify the $_ string in Perl for at least some of
       the filenames specified.  If a given filename is not modified by the
       expression, it will not be renamed.  If no filenames are given on the
       command line, filenames will be read via standard input.

       For example, to rename all files matching "*.bak" to strip the
       extension, you might say

               rename 's/\e.bak$//' *.bak

       To translate uppercase names to lower, you'd use
   rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

OPTIONS
       -v, -verbose
               Verbose: print names of files successfully renamed.

       -n, -nono
               No action: print names of files to be renamed, but don't
               rename.

       -f, -force
               Over write: allow existing files to be over-written.

       -h, -help
               Help: print SYNOPSIS and OPTIONS.

       -m, -man
               Manual: print manual page.

       -V, -version
            Version: show version number.

       -e      Expression: code to act on files name.

               May be repeated to build up code (like "perl -e").  If no -e,
               the first argument is used as code.

       -E      Statement: code to act on files name, as -e but terminated by
               ';'.

ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.
